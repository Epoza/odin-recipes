        <p>Cooking a pan seared steak can be tricky, whether that be getting a 
           crispy golden-brown sear on both sides or choosing the right ingredients to give your 
           steak that extra boost of flavor. There are also many different cuts of 
           steaks to choose from aswell as thickness of the steak which can alter 
           the results. Although I recommend Ribeye or New York Strip for this recipe 
           any steak will work with a little tweaking to the cooking time. Once you learn this recipe it 
           will be one of your favorites to cook!
